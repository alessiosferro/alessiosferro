## Hi, I am Alessio. Web Developer 👋😎

Welcome to my GitHub profile 🚀

I am currently working on the UI of [Kronos](https://github.com/ostafen/kronos), a powerful cron job webhook scheduler that allows you to define and manage scheduled tasks with ease.

I'm following the "fullstack learning path" on Frontend Masters.
I am really enjoying learning shell scripting, VIM (and Neovim), database fundamentals and server side JavaScript programming in Node.js!

I currently work as Senior Frontend Developer in The Wave Studio, a web agency based in Catania.
I am proficient in Angular and React (and Next.js), and I have a lot of experience (5+ years) in developing reactive, responsive and beatiful websites.

Please, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or by email if you have any questions or want to collaborate on an open source project.

Have a wonderful and productive day 🏄
